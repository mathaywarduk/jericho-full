# Booking terms

Please make us aware of food allergies at least 48 hours before your reservation. We do not cater to Pescatariants, Vegetarians, Vegans or Dislikes at this time.

If adequate notice is not given of allergies we cannot offer an alternative menu but will do our best to cater to them within the menu at that time. A full menu charge will remain.

Cancellations must be made a minimum of 48-hours in advance of your booking.

You can cancel your reservation directly through Res-Diary or call 01949 728288. If you do not show for your reservation or you cancel within 48-hours of your reservation, you will be charged £90 per guest.

Should your reservation be rearranged, any further alteration to the booking will result in a £90 per head charge.

Our maximum table size is for 6 guests.

Service Charge: Please note, a 10% discretionary service charge will be added to your bill. If you would prefer this charge be removed, please simply ask before paying

We look forward to serving you, Restaurant Jericho
