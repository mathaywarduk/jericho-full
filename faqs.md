## What are your opening hours?

See <a href="https://booking.resdiary.com/widget/Standard/RestaurantJericho/37740" target="_blank">reservations</a> for the most up-to-date details.

Our evening tasting menu is available Friday to Saturday at 7pm. Dinner usually finishes around 10.30pm so we would advise booking taxis between 10.30pm and 11pm.

Our WIP evenings are on Thursdays only at 7pm, dinner usually finishes at 9.30pm.

Our bar is open Friday and Saturday from 6.30pm.


## Do you have parking?

Yes, we have a large car park to the rear of the restaurant, between the two barns.

You are welcome to leave your car overnight should you wish to arrange a taxi home.

Please note all vehicles and belongings are left at your own risk. 

## Do you cater to Allergies and Dietary requirements?

Whilst we follow best practice at all times, our dishes are created in an environment where allergens are prepared, stored and cooked. This makes it unsuitable for those with severe allergies, as we are unable to guarantee the menu will be completely allergen free. 

**We do not cater to vegans, vegetarians, pescatarians or dislikes.**

**_We are happy to accommodate pregnancy diets however, we will omit elements of our dishes rather than substitute them._**

For any other dietary requirement, please contact us via email or telephone to discuss with our team. Please inform us at least 72 hours prior to your booking date – otherwise we won’t be able to make the changes and you will still be charged.

If you are making a group booking, it is your responsibility to make us aware of any dietary requirements for all guests in your group.


## Can I cancel or modify my booking?

Yes, as long as we have at least 72 hours’ notice. Your deposit in non-refundable and non-transferable. If there are any cancellations or amendments to bookings (in part or whole) with less than 72 hours notice, a full £105pp dinner fee will be charged (Your deposit will be included in this amount). This charge reflects the cost of food, drink and staffing incurred with short-notice changes.

Our restaurant is an intimate setting; the largest table we can accommodate for is 6 guests, should you wish to book for 4 or more people, we will need 14 days notice for cancellation, otherwise a full £105pp dinner fee will be charged. (Your deposit will be included in this amount)
